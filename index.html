	<p> iKnowledge Solutions was my first real job. Having worked with them as part of my work placement in college initially. After finishing college I returned to work for them. After my team heard I wanted to move on, they prepared this to help me. </p>

	<h3><a href="" target="_blank"> Augmented Reality Part builder </a></h3>
	<p>
		One of the major projects I worked on in Iknowledge was an application for the Microsoft Hololens. It was meant to be a proof of concept that Augmented reality could be used and be beneficial to  Electronic Work Instruction(EWI). EWI are software designed for manufacturing, it presents the instructions on how a worker is to accomplish their assigned tasks alongside any tools that are required and any tests or inspections needed to be carried out on a screen. The Part Builder App was to take this and apply it to an Augmented Reality environment.

	<h1> Project History </h1>
	<p> 
		This webpage is for me to talk a little about some of the personal projects I have worked or am working on.
	</p>

	<h2> <a href="">The Slow Escape</a> </h2>
	<p>
		This was a project my cousin and I started together in Autumn 2019. My cousin wanted to learn a bit about coding and make a game so we collaborated over 3 months in our spare time together to create "The Slow Escape".
		<br>
		The Slow Escape is a platformer inspired by the games <a href="https://armorgames.com/play/13662/give-up" target="_blank">Give Up</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyaoospH_Ow" target="_blank"> games</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/" target="_blank">Super Meat Boy</a>. Platforming occurs on a level by level basis where you must complete the previous level to unlock the next. Individual Level structure split out out into several stages, each stage has a goal that the player must reach to advance to the next stage. Level stages overlap on top of another so the challenge increases the further into the level you progress. 
		<br>
		Some Features of the game:
		<ul>
			<li>12 levels</li>
			<li>Progressive damage that shows on the character(per level)</li>
			<li>125 achievements</li>
			<li>Save files</li>

		</ul>
		Once we got the game to a very unpolished but completed state we decided to end development for various reasons.
